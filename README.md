# Secret Sharing

This is a toy implementation of Shamir's secret sharing, a multiparty computation scheme that splits a secret into _m_ shares and requires any _n_ shares to reconstruct, _n_ â‰¤ _m_.

## Usage

The `SplitSecret` class takes a secret (in bytes), a threshold _n_ and the number of participants _m_. It optionally accepts an integer _p_ which will be the order of the field and defaults to the 8<sup>th</sup> Mersenne prime _M_<sub>31</sub> if not given.

Shares are generated by invoking the `sample` method, which returns a sequence of _m_ points on the curve.

Passing a sequence of at least _n_ shares to the `combine` function (and optionally _p_ if different from the default) will result in the original secret being returned.

### Example

```python
ss = SplitSecret(secret, 3, 5)
shares = ss.sample()

recovered_secret = combine(shares)
assert secret == recovered_secret
```
